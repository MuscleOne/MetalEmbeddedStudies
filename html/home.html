  	To explore how metal fragments implanted in the human body effect our health, a series of experiments were conducted to obtain transcriptomics data from rats with metal implants. Here, we manually curate the data and present a webapp for researchers to search, download and analyze the relative data directly.
  </p>
  <h2>Datasets</h2>
  <p>
  As of 1-Nov-2021, datasets were included are as follows:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data related to expression profiling
        <ul>
          <li>Expression values</li>
          <li>Information on animal ID, testing sample name and treatment information such as embodied metal name, tissue type, sample collecting time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
        
      <li>
        Data related to weight
        <ul>
          <li>Weight values</li>
          <li>Information on animal ID and treatment information such as embodied metal name, euthanized time, weighting time</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Data related to metal concentration at euthanasia
        <ul>
          <li>Concentration of a metal (say Ni) in a tissue in rats embodied with this metal</li>
          <li>Concentration of a metal (say Ni) in a tissue in rats embodied with Ta</li>
          <li>Three types of tissues: serum, stomach, urine</li>
          <li>Concentration of creatinine for animal euthanasia</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Functions</h2>
  <p>Users can find there are three sub-items of the query tab in the sidebar panel: Expression, Weight and Concentration. Download is available once query results are obtained. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Expression item, one can search both expression matrix and the metadata of the samples, by given conditions of library, metal embedded and the collected month of the sample. </li>
      <li>In the weight item, one can search the weight of the rats, by given conditions of metal embedded, the euthanized period, and the measure time points.</li>
      <li>In the concentration item, one can search the weight of the rats, by given conditions of metal embedded, the euthanized period, and the measure types.</li>
    </ul>
